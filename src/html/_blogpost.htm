    Outdoor Optic Fiber Cable for Enhanced Optical Communication Systems
  </h2>
  <p class="p-blogpost mb-20">
    A fiber-optic network transmits data using light signals through thin strands of glass or plastic fibers. These fibers, each as thin as a human hair, are bundled together and can carry massive amounts of data over long distances at incredibly high speeds. Unlike traditional copper cables, which use electrical signals, fiber-optic cables convert data into light pulses. These light signals travel through the core of the fiber, reflecting off the walls of the cable, allowing information to move without loss of quality or speed, even across vast distances.
